        "\n",
        "# Q1: What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "# Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure code.\n",
        "# It helps with code reusability, scalability, and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q2: What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "# A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods common to all objects of that type.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q3: What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "# An object is an instance of a class. It holds actual data and can perform operations defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q4: What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "# Abstraction hides implementation details and only shows the essential features.\n",
        "# Encapsulation wraps data and methods into a single unit and restricts direct access to some of the object's components.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q5: What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "# Dunder methods (like __init__, __str__) are special methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores. They allow operator overloading and object customization.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q6: Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "# Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q7: What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "# Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. It enables method overriding and overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q8: How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "# Encapsulation is achieved by using private variables (prefixing variable names with _) and providing getter/setter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q9: What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "# A constructor is a special method (__init__) used to initialize the attributes of an object when it's created.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q10: What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "# Class methods use @classmethod and receive the class as the first argument. Static methods use @staticmethod and donâ€™t receive any implicit first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q11: What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "# Python doesnâ€™t support traditional method overloading, but it can be achieved by default arguments or variable-length arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q12: What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "# Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q13: What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "# @property is used to define getter methods that can be accessed like attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q14: Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "# Polymorphism improves flexibility and integration by allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q15: What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "# An abstract class cannot be instantiated and is meant to be inherited. It can have abstract methods using the @abstractmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q16: What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "# Reusability, scalability, modularity, abstraction, and encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q17: What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "# A class variable is shared by all instances, while an instance variable is unique to each instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q18: What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "# Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q19: Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "# __str__ returns a readable string representation. __repr__ returns an unambiguous representation used for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q20: What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "# super() allows access to methods of the superclass, useful in method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q21: What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "# __del__ is a destructor method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q22: What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "# @staticmethod does not take any default argument. @classmethod takes class as the first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q23: How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "# Through method overriding, the same method name can behave differently in different subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q24: What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "# Method chaining is when multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line by returning self.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q25: What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "# __call__ allows an instance of a class to be called like a function.\n",
